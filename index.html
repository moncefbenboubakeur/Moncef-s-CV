    <hr>
    <p>As a Client Technical Solutioner, I was responsible for developing and selling strategic

    <p>In my role, I provided guidance to architects on solution strategy and scope and
    worked closely with management to address any issues and suggest appropriate
    resolutions. I also developed base cases, cost cases, FTE calculations, and financial
    models, ensuring that all financial data was accurate and aligned with project
    objectives</p>
    <p>Leveraging my expertise in project management and financial analysis, I led my team
    in delivering innovative outsourcing solutions that met or exceeded client
    expectations. Through my efforts, I contributed to the growth and success of the
    organization, helping to establish it as a leading provider of strategic outsourcing
    solutions.</p>

    <p>At a world-renowned pharmaceutical organization based in Prague, I served as a
    Project Manager, leading a global project on Forms Automation in HR. My primary
    responsibilities included ensuring the project's overall timely and budgeted delivery,
    coordinating team members, identifying and flagging potential issues, and fully
    documenting the project's outcomes for future reference.</p>
    <p>In my role, I supported the design and implementation of the global HR services
    strategy and culture, and I oversaw the end-to-end design and delivery of underlying
    business processes to align the solution with "best in class" benchmarks. My focus
    was on Forms Automation, Knowledge Management, and Virtual Agents (Chatbots).
    </p>
    <p>During my tenure, I spearheaded the development and rollout of Letter Proving

    <h3>People & Project Manager</h3>
    <p>IBM, Czech Republic | Apr 2018 - Mar 2019</p>
    <hr>
    <p>As the People & Project Manager, I provided leadership and oversight to a diverse
    team of 25 IT professionals, I served as a single point of authority/contact for project
    tracking and reporting, which involved applying techniques for planning, tracking,
    change control, and risk management. By doing so, I ensured that project progress
    was accurately tracked and reported to enable a single consolidated view of scope,
    cost, schedule, and contractual deliverables. I worked closely with stakeholders to
    identify, analyze, and document requirements for new systems or solutions, ensuring
    that project objectives were aligned with business needs.</p>
    <p>In terms of team leadership, I led the team to track progress, report impediments,
    fulfill commitments, and identify bottlenecks in the delivery process. I also planned
    the team's budget (hours), ensuring that resources were allocated appropriately.
    To provide regular updates to stakeholders, I provided project status reports on
    agreed-upon frequencies, containing an executive summary of the project status.

    was dedicated to building AI solutions. I also led the first Crowdsourcing project in
    the center, which involved training 130 project members to develop industry
    chatbots in multiple languages.</p>
    <p>In addition, I served as the project manager for Watson Blue Umbrella AI Team and
    Watson Compare&Comply, where I led projects focused on training AI to read and
    understand PDF files, extract entities and sentiment, and perform speech-to-text
    transcription. I also led efforts to validate speech data collected via a mobile app and
    built Watson's capability to compare documents.
    Overall, my experience as a project manager has allowed me to hone my skills in team
    leadership, project tracking, risk management, and stakeholder communication, as
    demonstrated by my track record of successfully delivering complex projects on time
    and within budget.</p>
